Here is the recipe to make your favourite homemade delicious and healthy bar of Milk Chocolate:

1. Take a Saucepan and put it onto the Gas with Medium Flame.

2. Firstly, add Two cups of Water straight into the saucepan keeping it on Medium Flame Throughout.

3. Let the water boil for at least 5 minutes or till you see bubbles popping out of the water.

4. Take a large-sized bowl made up of glass. Borosilicate glass is more preferred because it has more durability than a normal glass which reduces the chances of breaking but if not available, then a usual glass bowl will work too, and keep it onto the saucepan just like a lid. Make sure that the glass bowl should not fall into the saucepan.

5. Add the Half cup of Cocoa Butter into the glass bowl.

6. Stir the Cocoa Butter with a Spatula and if not available, with any large spoon or stirrir to avoid burning the Butter.

7. Keep stirring the Butter for at least two to five minutes and then, begin adding the other ingredients starting off with Powdered Sugar.

8. Try to avoid giving a gap between adding the powders because it may result in burning a powder and concluding that, add the Cocoa Powder next.

9. Then, add the Milk Powder to give it a light and smooth taste.

10. Stir the combination for at least two minutes, and you will see a silky, and very smooth consistency.

11. Finally, add one single drop of Vanilla Essence (if you have) as the finishing touch for the flavour of a real milk chocolate.

12. Stir the liquid well and you will see that the chocolate has a beautiful fragrance.

13. Pour the chocolate out into your chocolate mould, or if you don't have one, you can also store the chocolate in an ice tray or any rectangular box you have to give the shape to your chocolate and then, store it into the freezer.

14. After around 20 to 30 minutes, take the chocolate out of the freezer and take it out of the mould or wherever you stored it and you will see that the chocolate has taken a wonderful shape just like an original chocolate and the taste of the chocolate will be unbelievably wonderful.

15. Your Delicious Milk Chocolate is ready to eat! Share the chocolate with your friends and family and I guarantee they will be amused by the chocolate too.
